This is a fork of https://github.com/shiretu/crtmpserver demostrating how to add an Audio-Premium-Only feature.
See https://github.com/caposguanatos/rtmpPlayer for an example for testing the feature

---------------------

Compile the package. Do the following steps:

cd crtmpserver/builders/cmake
cmake .

(this step will create all the Makefile's that are required. If some package is missing, the cmake will complain)

make

After you compiled the package, it's time to test it. Run the following command:

./crtmpserver/crtmpserver crtmpserver/crtmpserver.lua

If everything goes well, you'll get on your console a table with IP's, ports, protocols, and application names
If you see this table, then crtmpserver  is working.
